## Important - Please Read
Due to recent changes with the H700 firmware this has to unfortunately be a full-image release and not a simple update. This contains a partition layout change along with a few internal backend changes which helps bring simple changes for development purposes.

Apologies to those who dislike re-flashing their device constantly, however with this update which includes the new storage preference module this should no longer be a hassle to update to full images in the future!
