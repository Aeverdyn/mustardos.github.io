## Issue Log

## All Devices

Due to the differences in display panels muOS cannot guarantee that it will work for your specific device.  The muOS
crew **do not** wish to play cat and mouse games with potential revisions of devices that come out otherwise nothing
would get done besides fixing hardware issues that are out of our control.  Not to say that we _can't_ fix them it is
not feasible for us to be purchasing devices that may or may not have different revisions.
