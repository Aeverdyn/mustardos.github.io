### 1. Discouragement of Third-Party Distribution
**MustardOS/muOS** is intended for personal use only and should not be distributed by third-party businesses or

(referred to as ROMs) or hardware BIOS files. Users are responsible for sourcing any ROMs or BIOS files independently
and legally. It is the responsibility of the individual user to ensure that they comply with local laws regarding the
